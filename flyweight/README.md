Catalog: Structural design pattern

Scenario: There are objects or properties that use a lot of memory will not be changed after they are created (immutable) and can be used by multiple objects. 

Intrinsic and extrinsic states:
- Intrinsic state: The immutable data of the object.
- Extrinsic state: The data from the outside.

Examples: Render high texture models on the UI.
